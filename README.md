## Tips & Tricks

### Sass

## Session 6 – [⤴️](#all-sessions)

*🗓 S, Nov 23, 2018* <br>
*💬Lectures: 41-XX* <br>
*🕐 7PM-* <br>
*📍Home* <br>
*📱Instagram Post Link* <br>
*✍️Commits: XX* <br>

#### In the Stories Section, we will learn how to:
* make text flow around shapes with ```shape-outside``` and ```float```.
* apply a ```filter``` to images.
* create a background video covering an entire section.
* use the ```<video>``` HTML element.
* how and when to use the ```object-fit``` property.

#### In the Booking Section, we will learn how to:
* implement "solid-color gradients";
* how the general and adjacent sibling selectors work and why we need them;
* use the ```::input-placeholder``` pseudo-element;
* how and when to use the ```:focus, :invalid, placeholder-shown, :checked``` pseudo-classes;
* techniques to build custom radio buttons;

#### Progress🔥
* ✅ (16 min - Lec 41) Building the Tours Section - Part 3<br>
When some CSS is not working, the best way to debug is to inspect the element with the chrome inspector tools and play around with the styles.
* ✅ (20 min - Lec 42) Building the Stories Section - Part 1<br>
Used the ```transform: skewX(12deg)``` in ```_story.scss``` to skew the story container box.
* ✅ (14 min - Lec 43) Building the Stories Section - Part 2<br>
Whenever you want one element to be positioned over another element, you use ```position: absolute``` on the element and the ```position: relative``` on the parent element. Whenever you perform an animation, you need to use the ```transition``` property to determine animation speeds. Use ```backface-visibility: hidden``` whenever there are small weird animation glitches. This usually fixes it!
* ✅ (14 min - Lec 44) Building the Stories Section - Part 3<br>
Can go on [coverr.co](www.coverr.co) to download all sorts of handy videos for your website.<br>
Whenenever an image or video goes over it's borders, ```overflow: hidden``` is a very useful property.
* ✅ (19 min - Lec 45) Building the Booking Section - Part 1<br>
Learned a cool semi-transparent trick with ```linear gradient``` property in ```home.scss .book``` class
* ✅ (19 min - Lec 46) Building the Booking Section - Part 2<br>
Learned about ```font-family:inherit```.<br>
* ✅ (23 min - Lec 47) Building the Booking Section - Part 3<br>
Whenever you perform an animation on an element, you need ot apply the ```transition``` (helps determine speed) to the parent element, otherwise the animation won't work. Creating a custom radio button is super cool.
* ✅ (16 min - Lec 48) Building the Footer<br>

Downloaded icon set from [lineao.io](http://linea.io/). Note: using PNGs is bad practice for icons. Instead you want to either use fonts or SVGs.
Learned a bit more about transforms.<br>
* ✅ (26 min - Lec 39) Building the Tours Section - Part 1<br>
Note to self. It is **very** important to remember the ```;``` in writing SCSS files. Otherwise, the changes aren't shown aand no errors are thrown.

### Most important takeaways from today's learning session
➡️ TERMINOLOGY: Learned the CSS terminology (selector, declaration block, declaration, property, declared value)<br>
➡️ ANIMATIONS: @keyframe and transform property animations (learned some really cool button animations!)<br>
➡️ PSEUDO: pseudo elements and pseudo classes (e.g. ::after + :visited)<br>
➡️ REMs: instead of using px I'm now going to try to only use rem for determining sizes<br>
➡️ SASS: learned the fundamentals of SASS

*💭what needs to be optimized/changd next learning session:*
* in the future, always go to morning training--why? library doesn't open until 10am and in btw the time that YY goes to work and 10am you snack🍫
* in the future, avoid studying at home🏡 (except 4am-7am)--why? 1. will snack from fridge 2. high likelihood of falling  asleep on couch.
