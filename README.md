### Most important takeaways from today's learning session
➡️ TERMINOLOGY: Learned the CSS terminology (selector, declaration block, declaration, property, declared value)<br>
➡️ ANIMATIONS: @keyframe and transform property animations (learned some really cool button animations!)<br>
➡️ PSEUDO: pseudo elements and pseudo classes (e.g. ::after + :visited)<br>
➡️ REMs: instead of using px I'm now going to try to only use rem for determining sizes<br>
➡️ SASS: learned the fundamentals of SASS

*💭what needs to be optimized/changd next learning session:*
* in the future, always go to morning training--why? library doesn't open until 10am and in btw the time that YY goes to work and 10am you snack🍫
* in the future, avoid studying at home🏡 (except 4am-7am)--why? 1. will snack from fridge 2. high likelihood of falling  asleep on couch.
