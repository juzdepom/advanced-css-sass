*💭Thoughts on this study session:*
* studying for this long makes it inefficient. I shouldn't have skipped morning training. Next time I want to try going to morning training, then going to the library.
* avoid studying at home (except in the early mornings) because 1. will snack from the fridge 2. higher likelihood of falling back asleep on the couch.


learned more about positioning;
position: absolute (I didn't understand this super well before)
learned more about css animations..
@keyframes (never used this before)
transform: translate() for animations
learn about pseudo elements and pseudo classes

learned some really cool button animations
(include gif here)
check out the classes ```btn btn-white btn-animated``` in ```style.css```

took a 30 min break after initial pomodoro
7:40 am - break
starting again

another huge thing I'm going to change with regards to my coding: I'm now going to use REMS instead of PX (this is Lecture 18 - Commit 7)
